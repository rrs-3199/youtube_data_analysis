# Data Engineering YouTube Ana



## Overview

 This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured YouTube videos data based on the video categories and the trending metrics.
 
The goal of any data project is to eaxract value from the data and help buisness to take data-driven decisions.

### Why YouTube?

YouTube is the 2nd most visited website after Google.


## Project Goals

1.ETL System ‚Äî We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format.

2.Cloud ‚Äî We can‚Äôt process ample amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS.

## Services will be using

1.Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

2.AWS Glue: AWS Glue provides both visual and code-based interfaces to make data integration easier. 

3.AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

4.AWS Lambda: Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. 

5.AWS Athena: Athena helps you analyze unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data stored in Amazon S3. 

6.QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.

## Dataset Used
This Kaggle dataset contains statistics (CSV files) on daily popular YouTube videos over the course of many months. There are up to 200 trending videos published every day for many locations. The data for each region is in its own file. The video title, channel title, publication time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count are among the items included in the data. A category_id field, which differs by area, is also included in the JSON file linked to the region.
